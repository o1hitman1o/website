The table below collect known information about casing and enclosure compatibility for the StarPro64 SBC:

| Case | Compatible | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ROCKPro64 PREMIUM ALUMINUM CASING | No | StarPro64 has two stacked ethernet ports, making it too tall. |
| Model A Acrylic Open Enclosure | Partial | The screw closer to the LEDs and the one closer to the dip switches touch some components, potentially shorting or damaging them. Screw with a smaller head might work. |
