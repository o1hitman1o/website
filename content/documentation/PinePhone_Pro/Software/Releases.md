## Gentoo

{{< figure src="/documentation/images/GentooLogo.png" width="100" >}}

There are unofficial Gentoo overlays with ebuilds for the PinePhone Pro. There are no images - the image must be built manually, including picking the kernel, bootloader and the desired desktop environment. The ARM64 version of Gentoo has to be selected. The PinePhone Pro will not boot with P-Boot but will boot with U-Boot, there is an ebuild for it.

### Download

The overlay can be found under https://github.com/stealthgun/gjdwebserver-overlay

### Notes

See https://stealthgun.tweakblogs.net/blog/19830/gentoo-on-a-pinephone-pro for the documentation.

{{< admonition type="note" >}}
 Please consider cross-compiling the software on the computer. Long compilation times and heat production can lead to a reduced lifespan of the phone.

## Multi-distribution image

{{< admonition type="warning" >}}
 Work in progress; updating the distributions via their respective package managers may break the system.
{{</ admonition >}}

A PinePhone Pro analogue of the [PinePhone multi-distro demo image](/documentation/PinePhone/Software/Releases/#multi_distro_demo_image). This image allows the user to switch between multiple Linux distributions without having to swap microSD cards.

### Download

Clone [this git repository](https://github.com/Pavlos1/ppp-multi-image) and follow the instructions in the README to create a bootable microSD card.

### Notes

The shell script in the repository above was derived from [these instructions](/documentation/PinePhone_Pro/Software/Multi-distribution_image/).

## Various DPA Images

Multiple versions of unofficial images of various Debian-based distributions by the user DPA. They also contain some of DPA’s own software.

### Download

The latest successful image builds can be found here: https://repo.dpa.li/apt/dpa-image-builder/images/?board=pinephone-pro

### Notes

Most of these images are still in development / incomplete and DPA doesn’t have time to test them all, but they can still be useful as a starting point to get distributions running for which no other images have been created yet. DPA made these images because they wanted to run their favorite distribution, Devuan, on their phone.

The build scripts can be found in various places: [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/DanielAbrecht/dpa-image-builder), [my server](https://projects.dpa.li/git/?p=dpa-image-builder.git;a=summary), [GitHub](https://github.com/Daniel-Abrecht/dpa-image-builder)

In theory, these build scripts can create images for any Debian-based distribution which supports ARM64 and can be bootstrapped using _debootstrap_.
