Our goal is to push the envelope and deliver ARM and RISC-V devices that you want to use and develop for. To this end, we actively work with the development community and champion end-user initiatives. Rather than applying business to a FOSS setting, we allow FOSS principles to guide our business.

We are available on Discord, IRC, Matrix and Telegram, in the Forum and on Reddit.

The PINE64 community is large, vibrant and diverse. Independent and partner-project developers, hackers and hardware enthusiasts, privacy advocates and FOSS geeks - you name it, weâ€™ve got 'em all. 

They all contribute to the project thereby shaping it and determining its course. This page is community run, as is the Wiki, the chats as well as the forums.
